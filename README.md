This app meets the following criteria: 
- I am given three search criteria to search for super hero characters 
- When I click on the picture of a super hero, I am given the option to make a card from my selection 
- After I make my selection, my super hero card is displayed showing the character chosen and a soundtrack generated from the character chosen 
- On refresh of the web browser, I am shown all my previously made super hero cards.
